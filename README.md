## Weighted-SPHARM
The packge peforms the weighted version of spherical harmonic (SPHARM) represetnation of surface meshes including brain surfaces.

## Laplace-Beltrami eigenfunction expansion
The package performs the finite element method (FEM) based estimation of the eigenfunctions of the Laplace-Beltrami (LB) operator on surface meshes. Then use it to perform Fourier expansion on brain surfaces.

## Heat kernel smoothing
The package performs heat kernel smoothing on surface mesh data including brain surfaces. The method will increase the singal-to-noise ratio and statistical power of surface data

## Cosine series reprentation
The package perfoms the cosine series reprentation of functional data and curves including white matter fiber traccts.

## Exact topological inference
The package performs the exact topolgical inference on Betti-0 and Betti-1 curves obtained in graph data structures. The method can be used to topologically quantify the brain network differences.

## Morse filtration and persistence diagrams
The package performs the Morse filtraions for 1D/2D functional data and produces corresponding persistent diagrams.

## Betti plots of brain struactural covarite network data
The package distributes the brain structural covarite network data published in Chung, M.K., Hanson, J.L., Ye, J., Davidson, R.J. Pollak, S.D. 2015 Persistent homology in sparse regression and its application to brain morphometry. IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging, 34:1928-1939.
